# OS-Inspired Portfolio

This portfolio is designed to mimic an operating system interface, providing a unique and interactive way to showcase my skills, projects, and experience.

## Features

- **Desktop Interface**: The landing page features a desktop-like environment with the hero section as the background
- **Interactive Dock**: A macOS-style dock at the bottom provides navigation to different sections of the portfolio
- **Window System**: Each section opens in a draggable, resizable window with a proper title bar
- **Multi-Window Support**: Open multiple sections simultaneously and switch between them
- **Terminal App**: A simulated terminal is included for a tech-authentic experience

## How to Navigate

1. **Desktop**: The hero section acts as your desktop background
2. **Dock**: Click on any icon in the dock to open the corresponding section
3. **Windows**: Drag windows by their title bars, resize them, or close them using the window controls
4. **Multi-tasking**: Open multiple windows to compare information across sections
